# Design

## Wireframes & Bootstrap Templates

I used [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) to locate a suitable template to fit my vision for the SteakOverflow website, then mocked up my idea on a Wireframe Design

Wireframes were created for the site with [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

## Colour Scheme 

Colour palette was created using: 

* [Colormind](http://colormind.io/)

For the navbar bar `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)` was used for some transparency. Along with `#6fc02c` for any button hover.

## Typography

Open Sans, Roboto and Poppins were chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
